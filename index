    <h2 id="1">What is Artificial Intelligence?</b></h2>
    <p title="What is Artificial Intelligence?">Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
        <br>especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language 
        <br>processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</p>

    <h2 id="2">What makes them so useful?</h2>
    <p title="What makes them so useful?">Artificial Intelligence enhances the speed, precision and effectiveness of human efforts. In financial institutions,
        <br> AI techniques can be used to identify which transactions are likely to be fraudulent, adopt fast and accurate credit 
        <br>scoring, as well as automate manually intense data management tasks.</p>
